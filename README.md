# DSA-Group-Project-The-aMAZEing-Game
Our project is a 90s styled maze game called 'THE aMAZEing GAME'. 
It has 5 different levels of difficulty to offer with each level's maze having a possibility of multiple paths.
The game offers 3 lives to the user at start.
You lose a life everytime you bump into a wall or if you run into a dead end at which point you have no way but to bump into the walls.
There's a chance to increase your lives throughout the game but only if you are able to exit the maze through the shortest path available.
The maze uses dijsktra's algorithm to find the shortest path from start to exit.
The project also uses pygame's library to build the interface for the game.
